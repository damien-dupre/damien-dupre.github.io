---

This module is designed for students already mastering linear regression models, to give them a deeper knowledge of more advanced models: logistic regressions, multilevel / hierarchical models, and paths analyses (mediation, factor analysis, structural equation model). Each of these advanced models will be taught with JAMOVI (open-source software for advanced statistics and with R (open-source programming language for advanced statistics). The module will focus on how to test hypotheses using these models, how to interpret their results and how to communicate them in academic publications.
