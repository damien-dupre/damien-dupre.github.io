    "text": "This module has been designed to help you improve your understanding of the key quantitative tools and statistical analyses for social science and business research. To start you will explore the key concepts and issues in measurement, focusing in particular on numeric variables and multi-item scales. The main focus of the course is a study of the main data analysis techniques based on linear regressions and multivariate linear regressions. This will instruct you in statistical test selection using SPSS, JAMOVI (open-source alternative to SPSS) and R (short introduction). Finally the module will present how to interpret and to report the results of these tests. A key element of the course will be a study of several quantitative research study cases using multivariate techniques.\nLink to the lecture slides:\n\n1: Statistics, Research Papers and Me\n2: Understanding Models and Equations\n3: Collect, Clean, and Transform Data\n4: Understanding the General Linear Model\n5: Categories in the General Linear Model\n6: Assumptions of the General Linear Model\n7: Introduction to R for Hypothesis Testing\n8: Introduction to Quarto for Research"

With Anna Tcherkassof in Grenoble, I have contributed to develop the DynEmo database by recording and assessing dynamic and spontaneous facial expressions of emotions.\nWhereas my thesis aimed to evaluate Emotional User eXperience of innovative technologies and designs for the company Ixiade (www.ixiade.com), I have collaborated with Queen’s University and Sensum Ltd (www.sensum.co) to analyse emotions with physiological sensors and automatic facial expression recognition. I also worked at University College Dublin’s Insight Centre for Data Analytics in order to process and understand physiological measurements from marathon runners.\nNow Assistant Professor of Business Research Methods at Dublin City University, my domain of expertise relies in multivariate time series analysis and trend extraction for supervised or unsupervised machine learning classification."

    "text": "This module is designed for students already mastering linear regression models, to give them a deeper knowledge of more advanced models: logistic regressions, multilevel / hierarchical models, and paths analyses (mediation, factor analysis, structural equation model). Each of these advanced models will be taught with JAMOVI (open-source software for advanced statistics and with R (open-source programming language for advanced statistics). The module will focus on how to test hypotheses using these models, how to interpret their results and how to communicate them in academic publications.\nLink to the lecture slides:\n\n1: The General Linear Model\n2: The Generalised Linear Model\n3: Linear Mixed Models\n4: Generalized Additive (Mixed) Models\n5: Path Analysis for Mediation Hypotheses\n6: From Path Analysis to SEM"

    "text": "Analytics, combined with innovative technologies like big data, will underpin the creation of new and enhanced businesses. The analytical process begins with data, making it essential for future business leaders to ensure that data flows for business analytics are both efficient and secure. By developing skills and gaining hands-on experience in designing and implementing cloud-based databases and workflows, students will acquire proficiency in some of the most widely used technologies for managing data analytics within organisations.\nTo support this, students will be introduced to modern tools for data management and web development (e.g., HTML, CSS, Markdown), cloud computing platforms (e.g., the AWS ecosystem), and version control systems (e.g., GitHub). They will also gain a solid understanding of data security, including strategies to safeguard API keys and other sensitive information from breaches.\nThe ultimate goal of this module is to enable students to create an online portfolio that demonstrates their ability to deliver a secure and well-structured data project.\n\nLink to the lecture slides:\n\n1.
