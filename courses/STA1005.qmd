This module has been designed to help you improve your understanding of the **key quantitative tools and statistical analyses for social science and business research**. To start you will explore the key concepts and issues in measurement, focusing in particular on numeric variables and multi-item scales. The main focus of the course is a study of the main **data analysis techniques based on linear regressions and multivariate linear regressions**. This will instruct you in statistical test selection using SPSS, JAMOVI (open-source alternative to SPSS) and R (short introduction). Finally the module will present **how to interpret and to report the results of these tests**.
