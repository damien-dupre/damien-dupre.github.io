This module is designed for students already mastering linear regression models, to give them a **deeper knowledge of more advanced models**: logistic regressions, multilevel / hierarchical models, and paths analyses (mediation, factor analysis, structural equation model). Each of these advanced models will be taught with JAMOVI (open-source software for advanced statistics and with R (open-source programming language for advanced statistics). The module will focus on how to test hypotheses using these models, **how to interpret their results and how to communicate them in academic publications**.
