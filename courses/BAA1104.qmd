This module prepares students to **present their Business Analytics capability** clearly and professionally to future employers. Using GitHub, they will **build a polished eportfolio** that demonstrates their analytics skills and showcases business projects completed across other modules. The portfolio will be further developed through topics introduced in this module, allowing students to strengthen both content and presentation.

Core areas including regulation, information risk, security, ethics and sustainable analytics are explored through sessions led by expert guest speakers. Students also complete targeted online training via Kubicle, covering subjects such as GDPR, data security, and data ethics and risk.
