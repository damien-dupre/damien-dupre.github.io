A core component of my methodology is the use of Quarto, an open-source scientific publishing system. I will demonstrate how Quarto facilitates the creation of reproducible and high-quality research outputs (articles, presentations, etc.) by integrating text and code (R, Python, Julia). The presentation will advocate for the university-wide adoption of Quarto to enhance research best practices, transparency, and impact, aligning with the goals of promoting open research for global reach.\ndate: \"2025-10-15\"\n---\n\n[{{< fa tv >}} Slides](https://damien-dupre.github.io/open_research_quarto){.btn .btn-outline-primary .button_custom role=\"button\" target=\"_blank\"} \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![](img.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=4in}\n\n",
