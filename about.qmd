PhD in Social and Experimental Psychology from the University Grenoble-Alpes, France. My research centres on psycho-physiological responses in real-world settings. Working with Anna Tcherkassof in Grenoble, I helped develop the DynEmo database by **recording and analysing dynamic, spontaneous facial expressions of emotion**.

My thesis focused on **evaluating Emotional User eXperience of new technologies** for the innovation consultancy firm Ixiade (Grenoble, France). Alongside that, I collaborated with Queenâ€™s University Belfast and Sensum Ltd. (Belfast, UK), using **physiological sensors and automated facial expression recognition** to explore emotional responses. I also worked at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics at University College Dublin, where I processed physiological data from marathon runners to better understand stress and effort in endurance contexts.

Currently Assistant Professor of Business Research Methods at Dublin City University, I specialise in **multivariate time series analysis and trend extraction, applying these techniques to both supervised and unsupervised machine learning classification tasks**.
